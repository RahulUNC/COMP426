                    was sent into exile. His brother gladly followed his lead.

                    Rama is one of four brothers. His father King Dasharatha had four childeren
                    amongst his four wives. All four brother followed the morally just path of
                    "dharma" and each of them are very loyal to their familial bonds. Rama and
                    Lakshmana accompany each other throughout the entire epic of the Ramayana, 
                    while Bharta justly yeilds the throne to Rama at the end of the epic.
