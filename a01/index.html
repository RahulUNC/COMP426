                <p>Rama is one of four brothers born to King Dasratha. Rama was born as the sevent incarnation
                    of the Hindu God Vishnu, one of the three in the great trinity. He was sent to kill and
                    defile the rakshasa Ravana. Ravana and his followers had been desecrating the land around
                    them for quite sometime. 

                    As the years go on Rama meets his soon to be wife Sita, whom he wins over by weilding the
                    bow of Shiva. Rama and Sita lead a happy life as the ideal couple, until Ravana abducts Sita.

                    Rama and his allies wage a costly war over Ravana and his army to free Sita from Ravana's clutches.
                    After being freed Rama questions Sita's chasticity, which she quickly proves as being pure by
                    taking a test by fire.

                    Rama's brother yields the throne, and Rama and Sita live a happily ever after life.
